<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0b779f9">
<p>
Dominance hierarchy is at least 300 million years old (older than trees).
Neural biology for adjucating position in hierarchy is shared with lobsters (serotonin).
There is a plethora of dominance hierarchies in complex human communities.
Female animals generally let the men battle and pick from the top.
We have evolved to climb up hierarchies, hence development of general intelligence : situation independant problem solving.
Women also compete with each other.
New phenomena : Men and women increasingly compete inside the same hierarchy.

<h2 id="org41e313b">Commonalities</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org41e313b">
<p>
Humans can communicate because they don't have to explain everything : they rely on axiomatic commonalities.
Some things are built-in and don't have to be explained : joy, anger, love, jealousy, pain, fear.
Humans predicate in standard environment produce standard narratives.
</p>

<p>
The victor in standard narratives are the people who achieve victory in life.
</p>

<p>
It's hard to be a success. Being a failure means experiencing frustration, anger, disapointment, depression, pain, anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Culture (order, known, dominance hierarchy) is the primary narrative = Pride rock in the Lion King.

<h2 id="orgf145312">Fiction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf145312">
<p>
Fiction is not real because events didn't exist. But they are abstractions like numbers in mathematics.
In this sense, they are more real than phenomenas.
Manipulating the abstraction gives great power.

<p>
Digression on Raskolnikov : God is dead. Morality is thus just a mere convention. Raskolnikov is an embodiment of nihilism.
</p>

<p>
Stories can change the way you look into the world.
Strenghth of character : antiheroes grow teeth.
